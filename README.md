# security_frequency_analysis
A simplistic program for cracking passwords made with substitution encryption

Things I'd like to add:
- Currently I have minimal knowledge of frequency analysis, I learnt that the letters "e" "a" and "t" are the most common, and in the future I'd like to make some kind of program/script that could do this analysis instead of relying on online sources for this information.
- Implementing non-singular letter analysis: looking for the most common two or three letter words, or parts of words. Example: "the" "th" "at" "is" "are", ... (Formal vocabulary: bigrams, trigrams)
- Analysing based on multiple ways to do substitution: 
- Further improvements could be tailoring the analysis to the specific language used: which letters are most common in the x most commonly spoken languages?
-
